## Variables and Mutability

1. How to Declare Variables in Rust

    - Use the `const` or `let` keywords to initialize variables

    - The Rust compiler can interpret type annontations

    - Examples: <br/>

        ~~~
        // Initializing an i32 type variable that is immutable without the type

        let x = 4;

        // The default type for integers is i32

        // Initializing an i32 type variable that is immutable with a type

        let x: i32 = 4;
        ~~~
